👋 I'm Sara, an aspiring Business Intelligence Analyst.

I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences to the table, forged through a journey marked by curiosity, analytical prowess, and a drive for tangible results. My professional odyssey began in the fashion industry, where I learned not only the intricacies of business metrics and customer behavior but also the art of crafting experiences that resonate with diverse audiences (and therefore convert to sales💵). However, as life often presents unexpected turns, I found myself drawn to a more altruistic calling and became a therapist. As such, I honed my abilities in understanding human behavior, dissecting complex issues, and crafting innovative solutions tailored to individual needs. I've also been working on the side with a defense contractor as an administrative assistant, flexing my organizational skills and supporting the unique needs of the decision-makers. Through my own transformation, and that of my clients, adaptability has become quite my forte.

Driven by a desire for continuous 🌱growth and a fascination with the transformative power of data, I've embarked on a new chapter in my career by pursuing a certificate in Business Intelligence Analytics through TripleTen. Through immersive learning experiences, I've been developing proficiency in a myriad of skills including data analysis, visualization, reporting, and storytelling. I've been getting my hands dirty with five technical projects, using key tools including spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI.

Beyond my technical acumen, I harbor a genuine passion for the strategic potential of data-driven initiatives. I am captivated by the endless possibilities that data presents in driving organizational growth and efficiency. As I embark on the next phase of my journey, I am eager to leverage my diverse background and acquired skills to excel as a Business Intelligence Analyst.

Some fun facts about me:

🐕 I own a Cattle Dog.
🚗 I've driven across America 6 times (I picked my pup up on one of them).
🪨 My preferred form of exercise is rucking.
🎯 My goal for 2024: land my (new) dream job in data!
